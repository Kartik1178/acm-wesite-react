    para:"For many years, STEM fields—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—have been heavily male-dominated, with women often facing barriers to entry and advancement. Historical biases, societal expectations, and limited access to resources kept many women out of these areas, reinforcing a gender imbalance. However, recent years have seen a significant shift. More women are entering STEM careers, fueled by increased support, educational opportunities, and a growing awareness of the value of diversity in innovation. As a result, women are making impactful contributions across STEM fields, challenging the status quo and paving the way for a more inclusive future in these traditionally male-dominated spaces. One such woman is Mira Murati."},
   {
para:"Mira Murati is a pioneering figure in artificial intelligence and a prominent role model for women in STEM fields, where men have historically dominated. Born and raised in Albania, Murati grew up in an environment that lacked many of the technological resources found in more developed countries. Nevertheless, her curiosity and determination fueled her interest in science and engineering from a young age. Even as a girl, she showed a passion for problem-solving and innovation, which set her on a unique path to one day become a leader in the tech world."},
{
para:"After moving to the United States, Murati pursued her studies at Dartmouth College, where she earned a degree in mechanical engineering. Her drive and talent led her to opportunities in some of the most exciting and challenging areas of technology. Eventually, she joined OpenAI, an organization dedicated to developing and promoting safe artificial intelligence. Today, as the Chief Technology Officer at OpenAI, Murati is known for her role in leading the development of groundbreaking AI models, including ChatGPT, which have transformed industries and sparked global discussions about AI ethics, safety, and responsibility."},
{
para:"Under her leadership, OpenAI has not only pushed the boundaries of what AI can achieve but has also taken a thoughtful approach to ensure AI’s positive impact on society. Through her achievements, Mira Murati exemplifies how women are breaking barriers in STEM fields and redefining what is possible, inspiring a new generation of young women to pursue careers in science and technology. Her journey from a small country in Europe to the forefront of AI development is a testament to resilience, vision, and the limitless potential of women in STEM."

    para:"Artificial intelligence refers to the capability of computer system to perform complex tasks that only humans could perform, it has become a thriving field where innovative ideas are forged. It is actively reshaping our world from finance to healthcare and aims to revolutionise the way we perform day to day activities. Women have always been a vital part of the AI community harvesting different ways to enable AI in becoming a powerful tool. There are many pioneers in AI who have chosen the path less travelled and paved way for fellow women to achieve and dream bigger. These brilliant women have been in the forefront of technology and artificial intelligence. Two of such established women are Mira Murat and Claire Delaunay."},

     para:"Having over 15 years of experience in robotics and autonomous vehicles and having leading teams in various start-ups and research labs to being part of the fortune 500.She was the director of engineering at Umber and the vice president of engineering at NVIDIA. Currently she works as the chief technology officer of farm-nag prior to which she was also the robotics program lead in Google. She has had many technical leadership role in Silicon Valley’s organization. Delaunay on the trade-offs between working at a big company and a start-up: “Some kinds of breakthroughs can only be accomplished at a big company, and other kinds of breakthroughs can only be accomplished at a start-up. Start-ups are very good at deconstructing things and generating discontinuous big leaps forward. Big companies are very good at consolidating breakthroughs and building out robust technology foundations that enable future innovation.",}
